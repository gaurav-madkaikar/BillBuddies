## Introduction

This is a project I've been working on as a part of a course in my CS curriculum named as `Design Laboratory`. A full stack expense spliting app - made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Nodejs), specially designed to simplify splitting of group expenses. With this application, you can add your expense details and get personalized analytics corresponding to your expenses - Group Balance, Monthly spend graphs, Category-wise expense spending graphs and so on... Download the entire [Source code](https://github.com/gaurav-madkaikar/BillBuddies/) and run it on your server. 

## Key Features

- Create user groups and track group expenses
- Keep track of your shared expenses and settle your balances in a convenient and personalized manner
- Get analytical graphs to observe your expenditure trend
- Multiple user registration
- Authentication using JSON web token (JWT)

## Technologies used

This project was created using the following technologies.

#### Frontend

- React JS
- Redux (for managing and centralizing application states)
- Axios (For making api calls)
- Material UI (For User Interface)
- Chart.js (To display various analytics graphs)
- React-chartjs-2
- Gravitar (For user profile picture)

#### Backend

- Express
- Mongoose
- JWT (For authentication)
- bcryptjs (for data encryption)

#### Database

MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)

## Configuration and Setup

In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as a zip file and unzip on your machine.

- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal

```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```

For setting up the backend

- Create a .env file in the root of your directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=

```

Please follow [This tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i) to create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your MONGODB_URI

Provide some random key in ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET or you could generate one using node enter the below command in the terminal to genrate a random secret key

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```

In the second terminal (\*in the project root directory (back-end))

```
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)
```
